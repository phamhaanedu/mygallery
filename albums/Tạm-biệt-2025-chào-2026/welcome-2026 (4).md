Ultra-bright cute advertising studio poster featuring a cheerful, playful young Thai woman. She is smiling and laughing joyfully, sitting happily on a glossy pastel 3D number "0" while leaning playfully against an oversized rounded pastel 3D number "2", which is the first digit of "2026" and significantly larger than the others. Her long, soft wavy hair has natural bounce, and her makeup is fresh dewy style with rosy cheeks and glossy lips. She wears a soft pink oversized shirt over a white tank top, paired with light blue jeans, embodying a pastel casual outfit. The background is a high-key studio lighting setup with a soft glow, color palette in candy pastel shades, creating a bubbly, joyful, cute, and playful mood. The composition is ultra-realistic, high-end advertising quality, with an aspect ratio of 5:4, no text included. The subject interacts naturally with the glossy pastel 3D numbers "2", "0", and the other digits "2" and "6" forming the year 2026, all placed in a clean studio environment.
