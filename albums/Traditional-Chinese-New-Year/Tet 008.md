Keep 100% of the face in the uploaded photo. A cute East Asian girl, approximately 10-18 months old, is sitting on the floor in a clean studio.
Vertical portrait, minimalist, soft background.
She's wearing a dark red bodysuit with a subtle shimmer, long sleeves, and softly pleated shoulders. She's not too chubby.
She's wearing matching red socks, no shoes.
Her short, fluffy hair is braided into two small pigtails on either side. Her bangs are styled with a slight curl.
Adorable cheeks, fair skin, big round eyes. She has light makeup: orange blush and slightly rosy lips.
She has a surprised, curious expression, her mouth slightly open, one finger in her mouth, looking directly at the camera.
A small traditional hand drum is suspended in front of her chest by a string, with a red drumstick visible.
She's sitting naturally with her legs slightly crossed.
Above, red horses hang suspended.
The backdrop is a clean, smooth, light cream/ivory studio backdrop.
Small, whimsical doodles of red hearts and flowers are scattered around, cute and vibrant. The studio lighting is soft, with even illumination and subtle shadows.
The image is surreal, with natural baby skin texture, innocent baby body proportions, and high resolution.
