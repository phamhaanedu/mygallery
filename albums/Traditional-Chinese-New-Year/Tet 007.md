The uploaded photo retains 100% of the face. A cute East Asian girl, approximately 10-18 months old, is sitting on the floor in a clean studio.
The portrait is vertical, minimalist, with a soft background.
She's wearing a dark red bodysuit with a subtle shimmer, long sleeves, and softly pleated shoulders. She's not too chubby.
She's wearing matching red socks, no shoes.
Her short, soft hair is braided into two small pigtails on either side. Her bangs are lightly curled.
She has adorable chubby cheeks, fair skin, and big, round eyes. Her makeup is light: orange blush and slightly rosy lips.
She has a bright and cute smile, very playful and adorable.
She is sitting naturally with her legs spread wide, holding a red envelope.
Above the baby, two adult hands hold a traditional red paper horse on a stick, stretched horizontally like a playful pony.
In the center of the top of the image, bold red calligraphy reads "Tet" (Lunar New Year).
Small, whimsical drawings of red hearts and flowers are scattered around, looking cute and lively. The studio lighting is soft, with even brightness and subtle shadows.
The photograph has a surreal feel, with the baby's natural skin texture, innocent body proportions, and high resolution.
