Keep 100% of the face in the uploaded photo. A cute East Asian girl, approximately 10-18 months old, is sitting on the floor in a clean studio.
Vertical portrait, minimalist, soft background.
She's wearing a dark red bodysuit with a subtle shimmer, long sleeves, and softly pleated shoulders. She's not too chubby.
She's wearing matching red socks, no shoes.
Her short, fluffy hair is braided into two small pigtails on either side. Her bangs are styled with a slight curl.
Adorable cheeks, fair skin, big round eyes. She has light makeup: orange blush and slightly rosy lips.
She's smiling happily with her mouth slightly open, looking slightly upwards, full of joy and excitement.
She's sitting naturally with her legs spread wide, holding a small traditional hand drum in her hands.
Surrounding her are red balloons tied with thin strings, placed on either side of the frame.
The backdrop is a clean, smooth, light cream/ivory studio backdrop.
Small, whimsical doodles of red hearts and flowers are scattered around, cute and vibrant. The studio lighting is soft, with even illumination and subtle shadows.
The image is surreal, with natural baby skin texture, innocent baby body proportions, and high resolution.
