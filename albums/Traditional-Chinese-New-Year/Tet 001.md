Ultra-realistic, cinematic portrait of a beautiful young Asian woman in her early 20s, with a radiant and serene smile, preserving her delicate facial features. She has fair, smooth skin, captivating warm brown eyes, and long, dark brown hair styled with an ornate gold and pearl hair ornament featuring delicate hanging tassels. She wears a vibrant red traditional Qipao-style dress, exquisitely adorned with intricate gold phoenix embroidery and hanging gold tassels on the shoulder and chest. Her hands gracefully hold several red envelopes (lì xì) with subtle gold floral patterns. The scene is bathed in soft, diffused cinematic lighting, creating gentle highlights and minimal shadows. The background is a beautifully blurred bokeh of traditional Chinese New Year festive elements, including red lanterns, golden blossoming branches, and small orange fruits, all contributing to a joyful and elegant atmosphere. Shallow depth of field, eye-level shot, rich textures, crisp detail, 9:16 aspect ratio.
