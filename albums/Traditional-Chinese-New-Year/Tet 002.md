A hyper-realistic, cinematic portrait of a beautiful young Asian woman, approximately in her late 20s, with a gentle and confident smile, preserving her unique facial features. She has flawless fair skin and black hair styled in two traditional "ox horn" buns adorned with intricate golden phoenix hairpins, vibrant red fluffy pom-poms, and elegant golden chain ornaments cascading down. She is wearing a festive red traditional Vietnamese Ao Dai or Chinese Qipao-style top, made of lustrous silk, richly embroidered with large, colorful peony flowers in shades of pink, blue, and green, along with gold accents. She holds two red folding fans, one partially open revealing the auspicious "福" (Fú) character and golden bamboo motifs. Her eyes are partially obscured by slender, fashionable red cat-eye sunglasses. The background is bright and adorned with traditional Lunar New Year elements: red lanterns hanging at the top left, a vibrant kumquat bonsai tree and falling red envelopes with "福" characters on the bottom left, a blooming pink cherry blossom branch, a string of red firecrackers, and a golden auspicious cloud on the right. Soft, diffused cinematic lighting highlights her and the festive details, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Shot at eye-level, medium close-up, with a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the subject while maintaining crisp background details.
