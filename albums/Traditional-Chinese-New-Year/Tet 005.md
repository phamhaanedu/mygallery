Hyper-realistic cinematic portrait of a beautiful young East Asian woman, preserving her facial features, with fair skin, delicate features, and a gentle, inviting smile. Her long, straight black hair is elegantly styled in a traditional bun with some flowing strands, adorned with an intricate red and gold hairpin featuring red tassels and beads. She wears a luxurious, rich red traditional Chinese gown (Qipao-inspired), exquisitely embroidered with large golden peony motifs across the bodice and skirt, and subtle gold trim along the collar and cuffs. She gracefully holds a vibrant red folding fan, adorned with delicate white cherry blossom patterns, partially obscuring one side of her face. She leans against an intricately carved dark wooden window frame, with a softly diffused, out-of-focus background of lush pink cherry blossoms (sakura) on branches. Soft, natural cinematic lighting illuminates her from the front, creating a warm, ethereal glow and highlighting the textures of her attire. The composition is a medium close-up shot, eye-level, with a shallow depth of field, creating an immersive, high-resolution, and incredibly detailed photorealistic image.
