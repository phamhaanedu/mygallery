A sprawling, wet-street Times Square metropolis at midnight, New Year's Eve 2026. A colossal curved digital billboard dominates the skyline, displaying a hyper-realistic, perfectly lit portrait based on [User Reference Photos]. I am smiling confidently, wearing a highly detailed black leather jacket that reflects the city neon. A surreal breakthrough happens as I pour a glowing, effervescent stream of Coca-Cola directly out of the screen into the physical world. The red liquid cascades downwards, solidifying on the asphalt into massive, sculptural 3D metallic red letters that read 'HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026'. Below, a dense crowd cheers amid confetti and smartphone lights. Rain-slicked streets create long light reflections. Luxury advertising aesthetic, ultra-detailed, dramatic low-angle perspective, HDR, cinematic color grading.
