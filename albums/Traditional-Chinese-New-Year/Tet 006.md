Keep 100% of the face in the uploaded photo. A cute East Asian girl, approximately 10-18 months old, is sitting on the floor in a clean studio.
Vertical portrait, minimalist, soft background.
She's wearing a dark red bodysuit with a subtle shimmer, long sleeves, and softly pleated shoulders. She's not too chubby.
She's wearing matching red socks, no shoes.
Her short, fluffy hair is braided into two small pigtails on either side. Her bangs are styled with a slight curl.
She has adorable cheeks, fair skin, and big, round eyes. She has light makeup: orange blush and slightly rosy lips.
She's making a cute pouty face (lips pursed), very playful and adorable.
She's sitting with her legs naturally spread apart, holding a small traditional hand drum in front of her.
To the left, red balloons are floating, tied with thin strings.
The background is a light cream studio backdrop.
Above, elegant red brushstroke lettering reads "2026," with calligraphy subtly inspired by horses.
Small, whimsical drawings of red hearts and flowers are scattered around, creating a festive and cute atmosphere. The studio lighting is soft, with even illumination and subtle shadows.
The image is surreal, with natural baby skin texture, innocent baby body proportions, and high resolution.
